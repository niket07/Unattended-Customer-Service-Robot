# Unattended-Customer-Service-Robot
Using UiPath IDE I designed a robot which automatically gets triggered whenever a Mail is received. The mail contains the product name which automatically gets searched on Flipkart and Snapdeal. The robot then reverts a mail back to the sender which contains the list of that items in an excel sheet and also contains the item with lowest price and itâ€™s link.
